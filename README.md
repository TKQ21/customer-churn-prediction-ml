🟢 1️⃣ GITHUB README (FINAL – REAL WORLD PROJECT)
📌 Customer Churn Prediction Application
🔍 Project Overview

This project is a real-world machine learning web application designed to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) based on their demographic, contract, and billing information.

The system takes user input from a web dashboard, processes it through a trained ML model, and returns a churn probability with risk classification.

🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses.
Predicting churn in advance helps companies:

Reduce revenue loss

Improve customer retention strategies

Target high-risk customers proactively

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Interactive Dashboard)

Backend: Python (Flask)

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Model Type: Classification Model (trained on churn dataset)

Deployment:  Netlify

📊 Features

User-friendly churn prediction dashboard

Real-time churn probability output

Risk classification (Low / Medium / High Risk)

Clean UI for non-technical users

End-to-end ML pipeline (Input → Model → Prediction)

🔁 Application Flow

User enters customer details (age, tenure, contract type, charges, etc.)

Data is sent to the backend API

Trained ML model processes the input

Churn probability is calculated

Result is displayed with risk confidence

📌 Note

This is a production-style ML application, not just a UI demo.
The model logic, probability calculation, and decision flow are implemented end-to-end.
